# blog-GraphQL-practice-app

It is a simple blog application build on GraphQL, PostgreSQL and React. There is an GraphQL query and mutation for signin, signup and crud data. It also
contains simple basic frontend to test query. This application was developed for practicing GraphQL. The client side frontend will be updated later 
with typescript and all the missing details.
